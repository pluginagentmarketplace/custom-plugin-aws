## Learning Path

1. **Linux Fundamentals** → OS concepts, command line, shell scripting
2. **Version Control** → Git workflows, collaboration, branching strategies
3. **Containerization** → Docker basics, image creation, container management
4. **Cloud Platform Basics** → Choose AWS/Azure/GCP, core services
5. **Orchestration** → Kubernetes deployment and management
6. **Infrastructure as Code** → Terraform/CloudFormation, automation
7. **CI/CD & Monitoring** → Automation pipelines, observability
8. **Production Operations** → Scaling, disaster recovery, optimization

## Use Cases
- "How do I containerize my application?"
- "Which cloud platform should I choose?"
- "How do I set up a Kubernetes cluster?"

## Learning Path

1. **Start with Fundamentals** → Choose a primary language
2. **Learn Data Structures** → Master core structures
3. **Study Algorithms** → Solve problems efficiently
4. **Deepen CS Theory** → Understand computational principles
5. **Apply Best Practices** → Write quality, reviewable code
6. **Master Advanced Topics** → Specialize based on goals

## Use Cases
- "I'm new to programming, which language should I learn first?"
- "How do I optimize my algorithm's time complexity?"
- "What are design patterns in [specific language]?"
- "How can I improve my code review skills?"
- "What CS theory do I need for [specific role]?"

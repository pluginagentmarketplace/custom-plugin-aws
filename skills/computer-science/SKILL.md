# Computer Science Fundamentals

## Quick Start

Computer Science provides the theoretical foundation for all software engineering.

## Core Subjects

### Computational Theory

**Turing Machines & Computability**
- Church-Turing thesis
- Computable functions
- Halting problem (undecidable)

**Complexity Theory**
- P vs NP problem
- NP-Complete problems
- Approximation algorithms

**Formal Languages**
- Regular expressions
- Context-free grammars
- Parsing and compilation

### Operating Systems

**Process Management**
- Process creation and termination
- Context switching
- Scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Round-robin, Priority)
- Deadlock prevention and recovery

**Memory Management**
- Virtual memory
- Paging and segmentation
- Memory allocation strategies

**Concurrency**
- Threads and synchronization
- Mutex, semaphores, monitors
- Race conditions and deadlocks
- Atomicity and happens-before relations

**File Systems**
- Inode structure
- Directory hierarchy
- Caching and buffering

### Networking & Communications

**Network Stack (OSI Model)**
- Physical: Cables, signals
- Data Link: Ethernet, MAC
- Network: IP, routing
- Transport: TCP, UDP
- Application: HTTP, DNS, SMTP

**TCP/IP Protocol Suite**
- IP addressing and subnetting
- TCP: Reliable, ordered delivery (3-way handshake)
- UDP: Fast, unreliable datagram
- DNS: Domain name resolution
- DHCP: IP address assignment

**Web Fundamentals**
- HTTP/HTTPS: Request-response protocol
- Cookies and sessions
- Content-Type and encoding
- Status codes (2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx)

### Digital Logic & Architecture

**Boolean Algebra**
- Logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR)
- Truth tables
- Circuit simplification

**CPU Architecture**
- Instruction set architecture (ISA)
- Fetch-decode-execute cycle
- Registers and cache hierarchy
- Pipelining and instruction parallelism

**Memory Hierarchy**
```
L1 Cache (KB) - Fastest, smallest
L2 Cache (KB) - Fast, medium
L3 Cache (MB) - Medium, large
RAM (GB) - Slow relative to cache
Storage (TB) - Slowest, largest
```

### Data Representation

**Number Systems**
- Binary, octal, hexadecimal
- Two's complement for negative numbers
- Floating-point representation (IEEE 754)

**Character Encoding**
- ASCII
- Unicode and UTF-8
- Text normalization

## Software Engineering Concepts

### Programming Paradigms

**Imperative/Procedural**
- Sequential statements
- Mutable state

**Object-Oriented**
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

**Functional**
- Pure functions
- Immutability
- Higher-order functions

**Declarative**
- Specify what, not how
- SQL, HTML, CSS

### Type Systems

- Static vs dynamic typing
- Strong vs weak typing
- Type inference
- Generic types and polymorphism

### Compilation & Interpretation

**Compilation Process**
- Lexical analysis (tokenization)
- Syntax analysis (parsing)
- Semantic analysis
- Code generation
- Optimization

**Interpretation**
- On-the-fly execution
- JIT compilation
- Runtime type checking

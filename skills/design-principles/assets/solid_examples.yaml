# SOLID Principles Examples
principles:
  single_responsibility:
    description: "One class, one reason to change"
    example: "UserService handles users, EmailService handles emails"

  open_closed:
    description: "Open for extension, closed for modification"
    example: "Add new payment methods without changing existing code"

  liskov_substitution:
    description: "Subtypes must be substitutable for base types"
    example: "Square should behave correctly when used as Rectangle"

  interface_segregation:
    description: "Many specific interfaces > one general interface"
    example: "Printer, Scanner, Fax interfaces instead of AllInOne"

  dependency_inversion:
    description: "Depend on abstractions, not concretions"
    example: "Repository interface instead of direct DB dependency"
